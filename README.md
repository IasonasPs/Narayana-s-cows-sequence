# Narayana's cows sequence

Experimenting with different implementations of the algorithm 
and also with hexadecimal and binary representations of the numbers,
as the decimal representation of the long type runs out of digits at around 10^19.

Exponential growth occurs when a quantity increases at a rate  proportional to its current size.
This behavior is typically modeled by the equation y = a * e^(bx), where a and b are constants.
or more specifically P(t)= P0 * e^(rt)

where : P(t) is the population at time t ,
		P0 is the initial population ,
		r is the growth rate ,
		t is the time elapsed  (or the number of iterations from a discrete perspective).
